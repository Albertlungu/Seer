Try zooming in.

## Overview

This project came from my curiosity of what things REALLY look like first at the macroscopic level, then molecular, then atomic, then subatomic, then fundamental.

The question that I asked myself was _"What would happen if I held an electron?"_

And to answer this question, I am making a platform where you literally cannot stop zooming in:

You first film a video on your phone or any other camera, upload it to the codebase, and start the environment.

Then, you start moving around, looking through a screen in 3D at what you could already see with your own eyes.

Then, you spin the scroll wheel.

## The Plan

So first, I will use Apple's native Photogrammetry model to turn the MP4 into a 3D model. Then, using Panda3D, I will create an environment around the user.

Once this is done and the user can move around in their own environment, some AI model would come in and analyze the room, determining what material each object is (not fully accurate).

I would then model each molecule myself to the highest degree of accuracy so that when the user zooms in to the molecular level, they can see **everything**. This means all the different bonds, bond angles, VSEPR types, and more.

They could then zoom in even more to see individual atoms, represented both in the Bohr model and through the QM model.

Zooming in even more would then bring them to the subatomic level so that they can see individual protons and neutrons.

Finally, I bring them to the size of fundamental particles: electrons, quarks, bosons, leptons, etc.

All of the above will be modeled as accurately as possible according to the current best theories in their respective fields.
